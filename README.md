# 2-Norm of a matrix
## Aim
To write a program to find the 2-norm of the matrix and display the result in two decimal places.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
	1. Get the input matrix using np.array()
	2. The 2-Norm of a matrix is given by 
![norm](./normeqn1.jpg)
    
    3. Find the 2-norm of the matrix using np.linalg.norm()
	4. Print the norm of the matrix in two decimal places.
## Program:
```
import numpy as np

# Type your code here

n=np.array(eval(input()))
ans=np.linalg.norm(n,2)
b="{:.2f}".format(ans)
print(b)
```
## Sample Input and Output:
![norm1](./input.jpg)
![output](norm.jpeg)
## Result
Thus the program for 2-norm of a matrix is written and verified.
